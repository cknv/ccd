Crappy Connection Debugger
==========================

This is probably useless, and redundant.

This is a small collection of tools written to troubleshoot internet connections over a long duration. You know, if something does a hiccup at odd hours or only once in a while, this *might* log it. It might also miss it. Who knows?

End note
--------

Also this is some of the first go I have actually written, so it probably sucks pretty hard, do not look for good examples and/or guidance to do anything. But suggestions are welcome, I would not mind making this a bit better.
